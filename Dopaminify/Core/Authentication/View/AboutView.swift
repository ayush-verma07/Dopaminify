With a user-centric interface built using SwiftUI, Dopaminify allows individuals, especially teens, to set their desired screen time goals through a series of personalized questions. Leveraging Apple's Screen Time API along with Googleâ€™s Chart API, the app is able to generate insightful charts that compare their goals with their actual screen time, empowering users to make informed decisions about their digital habits. With the ability to create accounts and update goals, Dopaminify offers a convenient and flexible solution for users to track and manage their screen time consistently.")

                Text("In the social media context, the dopamine loop refers to a cycle of reward-seeking behavior driven by the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and motivation. Social media platforms are designed to exploit this loop by providing users with instant gratification through likes, comments, and notifications, triggering the release of dopamine in the brain. As users scroll through endless feeds, watch engaging videos, and receive social validation, they become hooked on the constant anticipation of these rewards, leading to repetitive and addictive behavior as they seek to sustain the pleasurable sensations. This dopamine loop can contribute to excessive screen time, reduced productivity, and potential negative impacts on mental well-being.")

Recognizing the addictive nature of social media and its destructive effects on productivity, well-being, and routine, we were both desperate for a solution. Therefore, Dopaminify was created. Fueled by our desire to regain control over our digital habits and our personal experiences, to create an app that empowers users, especially fellow teens, to set and achieve their desired screen time goals, was a personal goal of ours.")
